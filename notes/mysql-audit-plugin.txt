MySQL Auditing with MariaDB Auditing Plugin



* MySQL Enterprise Audit Plugin – This plugin is not open source and is only
available with MySQL Enterprise, which has a significant cost attached to it.
It is the most stable and robust.

* Percona Audit Log Plugin – Percona provides an open source auditing solution
that installs with Percona Server 5.5.37+ and 5.6.17+. This plugin has quite a
few output features as it outputs XML, JSON and to syslog. Percona’s
implementation is the first to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL Enterprise
Audit Plugin. As it has some internal hooks to the server to be
feature-compatible with Oracle’s plugin, it is not available as a standalone
for other versions of MySQL. This plugin is actively maintained by Percona.

* McAfee MySQL Audit Plugin – Around the longest and has been used widely. It
is open source and robust, while not using the official auditing API. It isn’
t updated as often as one may like. There hasn’t been any new features in
some time. It was recently updated to support MySQL 5.7.

* MariaDB Audit Plugin – The only plugin that claims to support MySQL, Percona
Server and MariaDB. It is open source and constantly upgraded with new
versions of MariaDB. Versions starting at 1.2 are most stable, and it may be
risky to use versions below that in your production environment. Versions
below 1.2 may be unstable and I have seen it crash production servers. Older
versions also log clear text passwords.
