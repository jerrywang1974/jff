NOR flash: small capacity, fast on read but slow on write, execute code in place
           usually used for root fs.
NAD flash: big capacity, fast on write but slow on read, can't execute code in place
           usually used for data storage.

On raw flash storage:

    YAFFS -> YAFFS 2:  not in mainline kernel tree
    JFFS -> JFFS 2 -> UBIFS (JFFS 3)

On raw flash storage or block device(flash storage with Flash Translation Layer):

    LogFS: intend to replace JFFS 2, removed from 4.10 kernel tree, broken and unmaintained
    F2FS(Flash-Friendly File System): for high-throughput
    NILFS 2: for low-latency and continuous snapshot
